Harry Potter Bookstore
============

This is a demo app for [my talk at JS Conf EU](http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/#/speakers/sara-robinson-what-harry-potter-can-teach-us-about-javascript) on Harry Potter and internationalization in JavaScript. The app uses [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), JavaScript's [Internationalization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl), and [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js) to internationalize a simple bookstore app.

The app was deployed with [Firebase Hosting](https://www.firebase.com/hosting.html), you can see a [live demo here](https://harrypotter.firebaseapp.com/).

The slides from my talk are available [here](https://sarajrobinson.com/jsconfeu/).
